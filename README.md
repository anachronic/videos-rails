# RO Videos backend app [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/anachronic/videos-rails.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/anachronic/videos-rails) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/anachronic/videos-rails/badge.svg?branch=ci)](https://coveralls.io/github/anachronic/videos-rails?branch=ci)

This is a simple Rails app that stores videos. It's a toy project where I intend
to share some old RO videos.

It uses ActiveStorage for storing videos.

The objective of this app is, rather than uploading my videos to YouTube, learn
some rails and at the same time, publish these old videos. Maybe someone wants
to see them!
